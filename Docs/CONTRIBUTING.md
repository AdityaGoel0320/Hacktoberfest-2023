## üåü Getting Started with GitHub

GitHub is a platform that hosts repositories, allowing multiple people to collaborate on projects. Here's a simple guide to make your contribution to our project.

### 1. Creating a GitHub Account

Before you can contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. Go to [GitHub's website](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account if you don‚Äôt have one.

### 2. Forking the Repository

- **What is a Fork?**
  - A fork is a copy of the repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  
- **How to Fork:**
  1. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.
  2. Click the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button in the top-right corner.
  3. You should now have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 3. Cloning the Repository

- **What is Cloning?**
  - Cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

- **How to Clone:**
  1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
  2. Click the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button and copy the URL under "HTTPS".
  3. Open Git Bash (download if not installed from [here](https://git-scm.com/)).
  4. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.
  5. Type `git clone [URL]`, replace [URL] with the copied URL, and press enter.

### 4. Creating a New Branch

- **What is a Branch?**
  - A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the live version.
  
- **How to Create a Branch:**
  1. Navigate to the project folder on your computer.
  2. Open Git Bash in the project folder.
  3. Type `git checkout -b [branch_name]`, replace [branch_name] with a name for your branch, and press enter.

### 5. Making Changes

- Make your changes to the code.
- Ensure your changes are consistent with the project's coding style.
