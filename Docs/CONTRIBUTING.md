## Welcome, Contributors!

Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source project! Even if you're new to GitHub, git, or coding in general, you're valuable to our community. This guide will help you get started with contributing to our project. 🚀

## 🌟 Getting Started with GitHub

GitHub is a platform that hosts repositories, allowing multiple people to collaborate on projects. Here's a simple guide to make your contribution to our project.

### 1. Creating a GitHub Account

Before you can contribute, you'll need a GitHub account. Go to [GitHub's website](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account if you don’t have one.

### 2. Forking the Repository

- **What is a Fork?**
  - A fork is a copy of the repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  
- **How to Fork:**
  1. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub.
  2. Click the “Fork” button in the top-right corner.
  3. You should now have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 3. Cloning the Repository

- **What is Cloning?**
  - Cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

- **How to Clone:**
  1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
  2. Click the “Code” button and copy the URL under "HTTPS".
  3. Open Git Bash (download if not installed from [here](https://git-scm.com/)).
  4. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.
  5. Type `git clone [URL]`, replace [URL] with the copied URL, and press enter.

### 4. Creating a New Branch

- **What is a Branch?**
  - A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the live version.
  
- **How to Create a Branch:**
  1. Navigate to the project folder on your computer.
  2. Open Git Bash in the project folder.
  3. Type `git checkout -b [branch_name]`, replace [branch_name] with a name for your branch, and press enter.

### 5. Making Changes

- Make your changes to the code.
- Ensure your changes are consistent with the project's coding style.

### 6. Committing and Pushing Changes

- **Committing Changes:**
  1. Open Git Bash in the project folder.
  2. Type `git add .` and press enter.
  3. Type `git commit -m "[commit_message]"`, replace [commit_message] with a brief message explaining your changes, and press enter.

- **Pushing Changes:**
  1. Type `git push origin [branch_name]`, replace [branch_name] with your branch name, and press enter.
  2. Navigate to the GitHub page of your forked repository.
  3. Click “Compare & pull request”.

### 7. Creating a Pull Request (PR)

- **What is a Pull Request?**
  - A pull request lets you propose changes. It lets you notify others about the changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.

- **How to Create a PR:**
  1. After clicking “Compare & pull request”, ensure that the base fork is the original repository and the head fork is your branch.
  2. Add a title and describe your changes.
  3. Click “Create pull request”.
  
### 8. Commenting and Review

- Ensure to engage in the conversation if the reviewers ask for any changes.
- Be polite and respect feedback given.
- Once all reviews are positive, the repository owner will merge your PR.
